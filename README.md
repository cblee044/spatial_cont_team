# Spatial Contamination Team
Welcome team members. Please read this completely before interacting with our repository.

The motivation behind using Github is code management. Have you ever added to group code only to be hit with a compiler error because another member made edits while you were gone? Well, Github saves us from this problem. 

# Branches
Branches are like the "cool_codeV1", "cool_codeV2", cool_code_FINAL" files in the project. Ideally, we have one main, definitive, or master(you get the idea) branch. Then, new branches can be created by copying and pasting from the parent branch which creates a snapshot. There is no official name for these branches, but they are a sort of sub-branch.

# Commits
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Along with them are commit messages that describes the change and its motivation. Every time you commit, you have the option to commit to the current branch or create a new one. Let's try to never work directly on the main branch and instead on sub-branches. Only after our group agrees on a branch merging should the main branch be altered.

# Pull Requests for Merging
"Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors."
